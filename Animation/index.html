        <h1>NIRVANA</h1>
        <p>
          Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. Founded by lead
           singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic, the band went through a
            succession of drummers, most notably Chad Channing, before recruiting Dave Grohl in 1990.
             Nirvana's success popularized alternative rock, and they were often referenced as the
              figurehead band of Generation X. Their music maintains a popular following and continues
               to influence modern rock culture.

      <h1>BLEACH</h1>
      <p>Nirvana released its first single, a cover of Shocking Blue's "Love Buzz", in November 1988 on
         the Seattle independent record label Sub Pop. They did their first interview with John Robb
          in Sounds, which made their release its single of the week. The following month, the band began
           recording its debut album, Bleach, with local producer Jack Endino. Bleach was influenced 
           by the heavy dirge-rock of the Melvins, the 1980s punk rock of Mudhoney, and the 1970s heavy
            metal of Black Sabbath.</p>

      <h1>IN UTERO</h1>
      <p>
        In Utero, 41 minutes of raw, uncompromising rock that was unlike anything else in the pop
         landscape. Cobain, disenchanted by his overwhelming fame and the widespread media coverage of 
         his personal life, was ready to vent. From the opening lines of “Serve The Servants”
          (“Teenage angst has paid off well”) to the moving finale of “All Apologies”
           (“All in all is all we are”), Cobain’s bleak worldview was on full display. Many of the songs
            are best remembered for their gut-wrenching, stripped-back acoustic renditions on MTV 
            Unplugged, but In Utero is treasured among hardcore fans as Nirvana in their purest form.

      <h1>NEVERMIND</h1>
      <p> A multiplatinum album that knocked Michael Jackson off the charts.
        Nevermind was never meant to change the world, but you can never predict when the Zeitgeist will
         hit, and Nirvana's second album turned out to be the place where alternative rock crashed into
          the mainstream. This wasn't entirely an accident, either, since Nirvana did sign with a major
           label, and they did release a record with a shiny surface, no matter how humongous the 
           guitars sounded.
